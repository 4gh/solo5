 * Unit definitions:
 *
 * Ticks -  This is defined as a "tick" of the oscillator in the
 *          Intel 8253 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT).                            
 *          The oscillator is fixed by the hardware to run at about
 *          1193182 ticks per second  (or, 1.193182 MHZ)
 *
 * Counts - Unit where every "count" an IRQ0 will be fired.  It is 
 *          defined such that there are 100 ticks in a count, 
 *          for ease of mathematics. The number of ticks per count 
 *          is also the number to set the reload count of the PIT to.
 *
 *
 * MS     - Milliseconds
